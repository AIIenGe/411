README.txt on Testing assignment:

Task #1: The first task to complete was completing the "out of the box" test cases so that their results passed.

Note: Dependency included to run Mock tests
libraryDependencies += "org.mockito" % "mockito-core" % "2.26.0" % "test"

Import statements wrote in Test files accordingly.

Task #2: In the UnitTest File, I added three tests.

Task #2.1: Test the HomeController
Task #2.2: Test the History view template
Task #2.3: Create a mock of the Coordinate Model class and test the return value when using a Coordinate class method (getLongitude)
